Sarah Miller ("Mrs. Miller") and Michael Robert Miller ("Mr. Miller") (collectively the "Claimants") sue Morgan Stanley, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., ("Morgan Stanley") and Southwest Securities, Inc., ("Southwest") (collectively "Respondents"), and allege as follows:

## A. Summary of Claim and Request for Hearing

1. This is a case about a married couple with a disabled adult son that were solicited by their Morgan Stanley financial advisor, David Johnson ("Johnson") to invest in what was represented as a private equity investment. However, starting in October 2015 and continuing in November 2016 and March 2024, instead of investing $300,000 into the investment, Johnson pocketed the money and provided Mr. and Mrs. Miller with fake documents purporting to show the investment's performance. As private equity investments are illiquid for many years, Mr. and Mrs. Miller relied on the false statements that represented that their investment had substantially grown in value and would be liquid in February 2028, April 2029 and March 2036. Johnson represented to Mr. and Mrs. Miller that the Apollo Capital private equity investment would provide for their retirement years and their disabled son and granddaughter Mrs. Miller was concerned for the well-being of her disabled son and granddaughter as well as for the health of Mr. Miller who was diagnosed with Cancer.

2. In September of 2024, Mr. and Mrs. Miller were shocked to learn from an attorney representing Johnson that he had not invested their money in the Apollo Capital private equity investment and instead, misappropriated their money and falsified documents showing their investments performance. Mr. and Mrs. Miller's retirement savings which they were led to believe was valued at over $1.7 million was gone. Mr. and Mrs. Miller file this case to recover their stolen money and its lost appreciation.

3. The claim seeks compensatory damages of $1,000,000 against Respondent for theft, failure to act in the "best interest" of the Claimants, misrepresentations and omissions, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, failure to supervise, negligence and violation of the Texas Theft Liability Act and federal securities laws.

4. The Claimants request arbitration pursuant to the written agreement signed with Respondent (pursuant to Rule 12200 of the FINRA Code of Arbitration Procedure for Customer Disputes) and embodied in Respondent's application for membership or "associated person" status with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA"). The Claimants also demand arbitration pursuant to the provisions of the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§1-16, and requests a hearing in Houston, Texas.

## C. Factual Background

9. Sarah Miller, age 60, and Michael Miller, age 64, are married, retired and unsophisticated investors. Mr. and Mrs. Miller were married for over 30 years and in October 2015, they got divorced. However, after getting divorced, Mr. Miller was diagnosed with Cancer and the Millers decided to remarry. The Millers have a son who was diagnosed as epileptic at the age of 18 and has been declared disabled by the Social Security Administration. The Millers' son is a single parent who relies on his mother to help care for his 6 year old daughter. The Millers' son is unable to maintain a job as any stressful situation will cause him to have a seizure. As a result, Mrs. Miller retired from her job as a corporate event planner for Nokia and now helps care for her son and granddaughter. In addition to providing care, Mrs. Miller and her husband also provide financial support for their son and granddaughter. As Mr. Miller is ill battling cancer, Mrs. Miller takes care of her son and granddaughter.

10. In 1982, Mr. Miller began working for a printer company where he started at the bottom sweeping floors and worked his way up the company. After ten (10) years, through his hard work and dedication, Mr. Miller was able to purchase the printing company. Over the next twenty-one (21) years, Mr. Miller worked long hours and seven day weeks to make the company successful. His hard work paid off in 2013 when he sold the company and netted over $1 million.

11. With the success of selling the printer company, Mr. and Mrs. Miller looked to open accounts with a full-service financial advisor that would help manage their savings for their retirement years. The Millers opened accounts with Morgan Stanley and one of its financial advisors. They advised Morgan Stanley that they were unsophisticated investors and that they were looking to invest their savings and have it grow for their retirement years. They were not looking to speculate or take aggressive risks. Trusting Morgan Stanley, Mr. Miller opened an account and Mrs. Miller rolled over her 401K from Nokia. The accounts were invested in diversified investments.

12. In October 2015, Johnson took over as the Millers' financial advisor. On or about December 2015, Johnson solicited Mr. and Mrs. Miller to invest in what he described as a private equity investment. Johnson explained that a private equity investment would be a great addition to Mr. and Mrs. Miller's portfolio as it would grow substantially over the years. As Mr. and Mrs. Miller had never invested in a private equity investment, Johnson explained that the private equity investment would be illiquid for twelve (12) years and would be invested in a growth model. Johnson stated that the investment was called Apollo Capital and required a minimum of $100,000. Johnson explained that the Apollo Capital investment would be professionally managed and would grow substantially over twelve (12) years. Thereafter, Mr. and Mrs. Miller would be able to withdrawal the investment.

13. Being an unsophisticated investor, Mr. Miller trusted Johnson and Morgan Stanley and agreed to invest $100,000 into the private equity investment, Apollo Capital. Mr. Miller signed the forms on December 1, 2015 and was instructed that the investment would start in January of 2016.

14. On or about May of 2016, Mrs. Miller invested $100,000 into the Apollo Capital private equity investment. To the fund the $200,000 investment in Apollo Capital for Mr. and Mrs. Miller, Johnson had them sell securities in their diversified accounts.

15. As the Apollo Capital investment was illiquid, Johnson would provide Mr. and Mrs. Miller with updates on the private equity investment. These reports that Johnson provided Mr. and Mrs. Miller indicated that the Apollo Capital investment had appreciated in value. However, these reports and letters provided by Johnson on the Apollo Capital investments were fraudulent performance reports and letters.

16. In November of 2022, Johnson left the employ of Morgan Stanley and joined Southwest. At Southwest, Johnson continued the fraud.

17. On September 3, 2023, Johnson provided Mr. Miller with a purported letter from Apollo Capital stating that the investment as of July 15, 2023 was valued at $916,311 and that Mr. Miller would be able to take withdrawals on February 1, 2028.

Mrs. Miller's letter stated that she could start making withdrawals on April 3, 2029.

19. Johnson represented that Mr. and Mrs. Millers' Apollo Capital investments as of July 15, 2023, had a combined value of $1,702,742. Mr. and Mrs. Miller relied on these performance reports and were under the belief that their private equity investment had substantially appreciated in value.

20. Because of the performance of the Apollo Capital investment and the assurances by Johnson, on March 1, 2024, Mrs. Miller invested another $100,000 into the Apollo Capital private equity investment. The $100,000 came from an inheritance that Mrs. Miller received after the passing of her mother. This money was specifically dedicated to take care of her disabled son. On March 28, 2024, Johnson provided Mrs. Miller with the below Acknowledgement Letter.

21. It is important to know that Johnson was aware of Mrs. Miller's son's disability and his need for care. Because of his condition, he receives social security disability but it is not enough to provide for him and his son. Accordingly, Mrs. Miller explained to Johnson that she wanted to financially help support her son and that the $100,000 was being invested so that it would create a retirement nest egg for her son and granddaughter.

22. On or about September 2024, Mrs. Miller received a letter from Mark Thompson of Southwest advising that Johnson was no longer with the firm. Thereafter, on September 12, 2024, Mr. and Mrs. Miller received an email from attorney Patricia Rodriguez who stated that he represented Johnson and that his client had committed criminal conduct in the misappropriation of Mr. and Mrs. Miller's $300,000.

23. Mr. and Mrs. Miller was under the belief that they had a substantial retirement nest egg from the Apollo Capital investment that would be liquid in February 2028 and April 2029. The remaining $100,000 for their disabled son would be liquid in 2036. This representation was false and Johnson while under the supervision of Morgan Stanley and then Southwest had misappropriated the $300,000 investment. Had the $300,000 been invested properly, Mr. and Mrs. Miller would have close to $1,000,000.

24. Today, Mr. and Mrs. Miller are both dealing with health issues and are worried about the ability to care for their disabled son and granddaughter. Johnson led Mr. and Mrs. Miller to believe that their Apollo Capital investments would be worth over $2 million. Now, they learned that not only is the $2 million gone but they no longer have the $300,000 they invested. The money was stolen by Johnson. Mrs. Miller has no income coming in as she is retired, caring for her son and granddaughter. The Millers son is unable to hold a job because of his disability which causes seizures and the disability benefits he receives is not enough to support him and his son. The Millers are concerned about their ability to provide for their retirement years and their family. Mr. Miller is battling cancer and Mrs. Miller has been diagnosed with Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The stress of the financial theft has caused the Millers great pain. Accordingly, the Millers file this claim to recover the lost appreciation of their $300,000 investment which would be worth nearly $1 million.

**(Fraud Against All Respondent)**

25. Claimants refer to and incorporate herein Paragraphs 1 through 24, of this Complaint to the extent consistent with this cause of action.
